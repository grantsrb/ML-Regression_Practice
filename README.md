##Finished Folders

Folder | Description
---------------|-------
matrices | A java class to make matrix operations easier

linear_regression | Python and Java implementations of multivariate linear regressions
logistic_regression | Java class for multivariate logistic regression

## Setup/Installation Requirements ##
* Java
* Gradle

## Setup/Installation ##
Depending on your project, you will likely only need the Matrices.java file located in the src/main/java/ path. The gradle project environment is only to do unit testing. So, if you do not care for the tests, here's what you need to do:

####Setup without Tests
* Clone this repository to your computer
* Within the cloned repository, navigate to the src/main/java/ file.
* Take the Matrices.java file from this location and put it into the same directory as the java file that you currently need to do matrix operations.
* Refer to Static Methods section of this README to know which methods to use for your needs.


If you're starting a new project or want to tinker with the Matrices class code, I recommend you use the project setup that I have provided. The tests will alert you if something has gone wrong with the Matrices class and you can easily set up new tests for whatever endeavor you are embarking on. Testing is good.

#### Setup with Tests
* Clone this repository to your computer
* Create new java classes in the src/main/java/ directory
* Create new test classes in the src/test/java/ directory
* Use src/main/java/App.java for user interface
